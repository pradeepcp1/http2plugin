# XMPP Connection Config 
![](xmpp.png)

XMPP Connection Config item is required for any XMPP testing script. [XMPP Samplers](XMPPSampler.md) takes connection context from this element.

TCP tansport is fully functional and tested with common XMPP servers, like `ejabberd`, `openfire` and `hipchat`.

Please note that `BOSH` protocol option is experimental and may be not fully functional.
